# GameAPI
A little GameAPI for spigot minecraft.
This project haven't been finished due to lack of time.
There is still some bugs but that's a great big code base if you want to get into coding minecraft minigames. 
Feel free to fork it and do pull request, i'll accept them :)

# Documentation

I may write some documentation on it soon.
